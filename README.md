# Catgram (Back End)

For this project, we attempted to clone a website of our choice. I decided to make a version of Instagram for cats...

## Getting Started

This project is not finished. This is the Back End for the project. Currently the database tables are populated with dummy data. With more time, these table would store the information needed to make Catgram fully functional.

### Installing

Right now, the code likely won't run on GH Pages, so you might have to download the code yourself...

## Built With

* [Laravel 6](https://laravel.com/) - The PHP framework used

## Contributing

If you've found a bug in my code, please feel free to send me an Issue!
